      <h1>Zurich</h1>
      <p>Zurich is the largest city and also the most beautiful city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of
        Zürich. Zurich is an upmarket banking city and the financial capital of Switzerland.
        It, therefore comes as no surprise that it's often labelled as the most expensive city in the world. Zurich is
        famous for luxurious lifestyles, high-end shopping, and fancy chocolates and all this at the foot of the Swiss
        Alps.
        I've always been interested in Swiss chocolate and seeing The Alps in real life.
